# Setting Dependency

To set this mod as a dependency to your own mod, you will need to add this to your `metadata.json` file:
```
  "relationships" : [
    {
      "rel_type" : "dependency",
      "id" : "com.github.Victoria-3-Modding-Co-op.Community-Mod-Framework",
      "display_name" : "Community Mod Framework",
      "resource_type" : "mod",
      "version" : "1.*"
    }
  ]
```
**Also remember to add the mod to your required items on your own mods steam page.**

# Debug Mode

The keybinding `CTRL + ALT + D` toggles the global variable `com_debug`.

This can be used to enable or disable debug content like debug Decisions or Events.

# Political Movements

CMF overwrites vanilla Political Movement definitions with versions that have scripted triggers to aid in mod compatibility

## Adding New Ideologies
To add dummy ideologies from your mods into political movements, allowing them to spawn with the appropiate mod enabled:
* Add a dummy ideology to CMF with the same name as your mod ideology in a file named `00_dummy_ideologies_<your_mod>`.
* Assign the ideology to the appropiate political movements (and scripted triggers if needed).
* Ensure the ideologies in your mod are in a file that will overwrite the dummy one (see [File Naming](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#file-naming)).
* Your mod will overwrite the ideology definition and allow it to spawn in the specified political movements.

## Modifying Movement Weights
Depending on whether your mod must depend on CMF, or is able to be used in a standalone capacity, what you do may be slightly different.
* Work out where you need to either add or multiply values for a particular movement.
* Add a bloc to the CMF movement that looks like:
```
# Your_Mod
add/multiply = {
	value = <your_mod>_<movement_type>_<movement_section>_<function>
	desc = "YOUR_LOCALIZATION"
}
```
> **For example:**  
> `mog_plp_movement_minority_rights_pop_support_weight_mult`  
> **Is made up of:**  
> mod: mog_plp_  
> type: movement_minority_rights_  
> section: pop_support_weight_  
> function: mult
* Then; create a file in common\script_values called `00_<your_mod>_movement_values`.
* Define all values you want added in this file, = 0 for `add` and = 1 for `mult` (as seen in `00_mog_plp_movement_values`)
* Define the values again in your own mod, with all the maths for what you need, in a file that will overwrite the dummy one. (see [File Naming](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#file-naming))
* *Optional:* If your mod will depend on CMF (cannot work without CMF) you can define the maths in your `00_<your_mod>_movement_values` file (as seen in `00_anzfp_movement_values`) as long as you have a scripted trigger for when your mod is active. (see [Community Mod Triggers](#community-mod-triggers))

```
gui_window = <event_window_key>
```

- [com_event_window_telegram](docs/event_windows/com_event_window_telegram.png)

### Usage Notes
- For ease of use, any modded windows with characters will expect a character scope for the arguments `left_icon = scope:some_character`, `right_icon = scope:some_character` and `center_icon = scope:some_character` if the event has three characters. Just like the vanilla events do.
- `event_window_duel` also has an optional progress bar that will display below the flavor text
  - This is activated by setting the variable com_event_window_2char_duel_var
  - The progress bar will pull the value from this variable; it has a maximum of 100 and a minimum of 0
- `event_window_crisis` uses six character scopes saved as variables; documentation is provided in the `eventwindow.gui` file

### Ethic Events
- Ethic events can have up to 9 buttons
- This is the order they are created in:
  - Center Button (Required)
  - Top & Bottom
  - Left & Right
  - Bottom Right & Top Left
  - Bottom Left & Top Right
- The Buttons do not support classical text but are optimized for texticons (i.e. `@innovation!`)

## EU5 Style Situation Journal Entries
Situations are meant to model clashes between factions on an international scale.

They can have multiple journal entries associated with it and provide a tool to model complex power struggles.

In the background, situations are Journal Entries with a few extra variables and a whole new UI.
This means using them should come natural to modders who have already used those.

Situations were inspired by [EU5](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/tinto-talks-70-2nd-of-july-2025.1823383/).

[The usage documentation can be found here.](docs/SITUATIONS.md)

[While the script documentation can be found here.](docs/SITUATIONS_SCRIPT_DOCS.md)

## Hiding Objective Header

The Objective header can be hidden by setting the global variable `community_gui_objective_var` like this:
```
set_global_variable = community_gui_objective_var
```

## Custom Social Hierarchies

To enable a custom social hierachy you have to execute this effect in a countries scope:
```
set_variable = {
    name = custom_social_hierarchy
    value = active_law:lawgroup_of_your_hierarchy
}
```
**I recommend doing this in the history file of a country `common/history/countries`**

## Custom Progress Bar Colors

This works by setting specific variables in the journal entry scope. These will change which progress bar is displayed. Currently, the following variables are used:
- `com_double_bad_gold_marker` -- replaces the journal entry marker in double_sided_bad with the marker from double_sided_gold
- `com_double_bad_white_bar` -- replaced double_sided_bad with white_progressbar_horizontal
- `com_double_bad_gold_bar` -- replaced double_sided_bad with gold_progressbar_horizontal
- `com_bear_spray_applied` -- removes the bear and lion icons from double_sided_gold and resizes the progress bar

## Sidebar Button

Screenshot: [Example](docs/example_sidebar_01.png)

How to add a new button to the sidebar.

First create an ideology in the `common/ideologies/` folder (See [example_button.txt](common/ideologies/example_button.txt)).
The icon set on the ideology is the icon shown on your button.
**Important here is that this ideology is never triggered or shown!**

Then we need a scripted gui in the `common/scripted_guis/` folder corresponding to the button (See [example_button_sgui.txt](common/scripted_guis/example_button_sgui.txt))

We then link those two via the localization of the ideology.
Localizations can be found in `localization/<language>/`.
Button ideologies have three localization keys: \<ideology\>, \<ideology\>_desc and \<ideology\>_tooltip

The key \<ideology\> should contain the name of your scripted_gui.
And the key \<ideology\>_desc contains the name shown when hovering over the button.
The \<ideology\>_tooltip is optional and will be shown as a tooltip if you hover over the button (See [com_gui_l_english.yml](localization/english/com_gui_l_english.yml)).
**Good practice here is to name the ideology and the scripted gui the same, so even if you do not set the localization key for a language, the correct scripted gui is triggered!**

### Adding the Button

And at last we need to add the button to the sidebar.
This is done by adding your ideology as a flag to a list.

#### Global

To add the buttons for all countries:
```
add_to_global_variable_list = {
    name = custom_button_list_flag
    target = flag:gui_sidebar_example_button
}
```

#### Country

To add the button for only one country:
```
add_to_variable_list = {
    name = custom_button_list_flag
    target = flag:gui_sidebar_example_button
}
```

This effect can be run wherever you want, like a journal entry or an event.
One possibility is to run it in `common/history/global/` (See [enable_example_button.txt](common/history/global/enable_example_button.txt)).

### GUI Window Visibility

When a sidebar button is clicked the following GUI variable is set to your scripted gui name: `com_open_window`
In your custom window you should check for it like this (with your scripted gui name):
```
visible = "[GetVariableSystem.HasValue('com_open_window', 'gui_sidebar_example_button')]"
```
If you want to close your window again you can do it by clearing the variable like this:
```
onclick = "[GetVariableSystem.Clear('com_open_window')]"
```

### Fullscreen GUI

If your GUI is fullscreen you will also need to set and remove the following GUI variable: `com_fullscreen`
The best solution is to use the GUI state system like this:
```
state = {
    name = _show
    # Toggle doesn't work here as it is still toggled on reload, so I have to set it instead
    on_finish = "[GetVariableSystem.Set('com_fullscreen', 'com_fullscreen')]" 
}
state = {
    name = _hide
    on_finish = "[GetVariableSystem.Clear('com_fullscreen')]"
}
```
Setting it will hide the base game GUI and removing it will show the base game GUI again.

### Custom Alerts

When you create an alert, you also need to define an action in a loc key.
This action string will be written into the GUI variable `com_alert_action`.

You can then check for this in your custom GUI like this:
```
visible = "[GetVariableSystem.HasValue('com_alert_action', 'Example Panel')]"
```
OR
```
visible = "[GetVariableSystem.HasValue('com_alert_action', Localize('mod_alert_send_to_example_panel'))]"
```
If you have multiple alerts which should all open the same panel you can use full line substitution:
```
 alert_first_alert_name_action: "$mod_alert_send_to_example_panel$"
 alert_second_alert_name_action: "$mod_alert_send_to_example_panel$"
 alert_third_alert_name_action: "$mod_alert_send_to_example_panel$"
 
 mod_alert_send_to_example_panel: "Example Panel"
```
> **NOTE:** If using this in a widget; you will need a scripted widget definition in `gui\scripted_widgets\` to load your widget.

## Characters in Journal Entry

Screenshots: [Single Character with Opinion](docs/example_journal_entry_character_01.png), [Multiple Characters without Opinions](docs/example_journal_entry_character_02.png)

To add one or more characters to a journal entry you need
to add them to a variable list called `com_journal_characters` in
the immediate block of a journal entry.

Here is an example where a countries ruler is added to a journal entry, but theoretically you can add whoever you want:
```
je_example_entry = {
	...
	immediate = {
		every_scope_character = {
			limit = {
				exists = this
				is_character_alive = yes
				is_ruler = yes
			}
			save_temporary_scope_as = list_character
			scope:journal_entry = {
				add_to_variable_list = {
					name = com_journal_characters
					target = scope:list_character
				}
			}
		}
	}
	...
}
```

### Opinions

Characters in journal entries can also have opinions.
To define them, you need to set the flag variable `com_opinion` on the character.
```
set_variable = {
    name = com_opinion
    value = flag:gui_character_opinion_example
}
```
The text behind `flag:` is a localization key (See [com_gui_l_english.yml](localization/english/com_gui_l_english.yml)).

**NOTE: Only one opinion can be set on a character at a time. So if you are using a character in multiple journal entries be aware of this.**

## Character Animation, Camera and Environment

To change a characters animation,
camera and environment CMF provides a scripted effect called `set_com_character_portrait` to set them
and another scripted effect to remove them called `remove_com_character_portrait`.

> **NOTE** This will change the character portrait EVERYWHERE the character is shown and will be PERMANENT unless removed! So use this effect with caution.

The `set_com_character_portrait` has three required parameters:
- `animation` - A localization key containing the animation name
- `camera` - A localization key containing the camera name
- `environment` - A localization key containing the environment name

CMF has predefined the base game animations, cameras, and environments.
They can be found [here](localization/english/com_character_portrait_l_english.yml).

If you want to use custom values for modded animations, cameras, and environments,
you can simply define them as localization keys, like CMF already does.

### Usage Example

One of the main use cases for this feature is probably showing characters in specific events.
Here is a very simple example event:
```
some_event.1 = {
	# ... event stuff

    gui_window = event_window_1char_tabloid
    left_icon = root.ruler

	immediate = {
		ruler = {
            set_com_character_portrait = {
                animation = com_animation_idle
                camera = com_camera_lifestyles
                environment = com_environment_agitator_main
            }
		}
	}

    after = {
        ruler = {
            remove_com_character_portrait = yes
        }
    }
    
	# ... event stuff
}
```

## Custom Owner Buildings

To add a new custom owner building type just add it to the global list `com_custom_owner_buildings` like this:
```
add_to_global_variable_list = {
    name = com_custom_owner_buildings
    target = bt:building_university # Use your building here
}
```
This can be done in history global or wherever you want this effect to run.

## Multi-line Production Methods

MPM edits certain panels in the UI to make them display extra PM groups by wrapping them around instead of adding the extra ones on the same line and causing them to appear off the edge of the panel or under other text and buttons. MPM provides changes to the following files:
```
gui/building_details_panel.gui
gui/goods_state_panel.gui
gui/production_methods.gui
gui/building_browser_panel.gui
```
**NOTE: Note that military buildings, such as barracks and naval bases, are NOT INTENDED TO BE USED WITH MPM due to the new unit graphics being displayed alongside the PMGs which now take up most of the space that the extra PMGs would overflow into.**

## DLC Icons in Journal Entries

To add DLC/Mod information to a journal entry, CMF offers the scripted effect `add_com_dlc_icon`.

It needs to be run in the journal entry scope.
The best place for that is the `immediate` block of a journal entry:
```
je_some_journal = {
    # journal definition
    immediate = {
        scope:journal_entry = {
            add_com_dlc_icon = {
                dlc = dlc_magic_gate
            }
        }
    }
    # some more journal definition
}
```


# Structs

CMF now allows for structs that can be used to categorize variables. They are especially meant to be used with GUI but can be used anywhere.

## Creating a new Struct
This command needs to run in a country scope:
```
create_struct = {
	struct_scope = test_struct
	struct_type = 1
}
```
The `struct_scope` is the output scope of the created struct that you can use to add variables or add the struct to a list.
The `struct_type` is a type that can be set on the struct. To use "names" here, you can define Script Values to use as a `struct_type`.

## Setting Variables on a Struct
After creating a struct, you can use its scope to set variables on it. Or use it as a variable in another scope:
```
scope:test_struct = {
	set_variable = {
		name = some_example_variable
		value = 42
	}
	set_variable = another_example_variable
}
```
```
# Country Scope Example
c:GBR = {
	set_variable = {
		name = some_variable_with_a_struct
		value = scope:test_struct
	}
}
```

## Destroying a Struct
A struct will live **forever** and can become a performance issue.
So you need to manage their lifetime if you are using them for temporary applications.

You can destroy them using this scripted effect:
```
destroy_struct = {
	struct = var:some_struct
}
```
```
destroy_struct = {
	struct = scope:some_struct
}
```

**NOTE: Internally structs are immortal Characters in the void. This means potential textures for the GUI could be set using a Characters ideology.**

# Fixing Variable Errors
When you are using a variable only in the GUI or in localizations, the game creates errors and spams the error log.
To avoid this, there is a helper scripted effect in CMF that suppresses these types of errors.
```
fix_variable_error = {
	variable = variable_or_flag_name
}
```
Usage examples can be found [here](events/community_framework_events.txt).

**NOTE**: This works for both **variables** and **flags**.

# Dictionaries

Dictionaries store numeric key value pairs.
You can use `set_dict_id` to create unique IDs in other scopes which support variables which can then be safely used as dictionary keys.

Keys can be any number from 0 to 2047  
Values can be any number from -45035996273.70496 to 45035996273.70495  

⚠️ Dictionaries store both the key and value in a single number using bit shifts, you must be careful to ensure your keys and values do not overflow.
For performance reasons there are no internal saftey checks. Using numbers outside of these ranges will result in undefined behaviour.

Alternatively, you can use a more specialized scope value map. This allows mapping any scope to numeric values. It uses dictionaries behind
the scenes, so is limited to 2048 keys and the same value range. Scope value maps do not support removing elements once they are added! Attempting
to remove elements from the map will result in undefined behaviour.

## Set
```
add_to_dict = {
  dict  = dictionary_name
  key   = numeric_key
  value = numeric_value
}

add_to_scope_value_map = {
  name  = map_name
  key   = scope:any_scope
  value = numeric_value
}
```
## Get
```
every_in_list = {
  variable = dictionary_name
  limit = {
    this.kvp_to_key = numeric_key
  }
  multiply = this.kvp_to_value
}

# Where scripted effects are supported
# `scope:key` and `scope:value` are available inside the limit and effect blocks
every_in_scope_value_map = {
  variable = map_name
  limit = " # Quotes not braces
    scope:key = {
      ...
    }
  "
  effects = " # Quotes not braces
    add = scope:value
  "
}

# Where scripted effects are not supported (eg: math blocks)
save_temporary_scope_as = base
every_in_list = {
  variable = map_name
  save_temporary_scope_as = kvp
  scope:base = {
    ordered_in_list = {
      variable = map_name_keys
      position = scope:kvp.kvp_to_key
      save_temporary_scope_as = key
    }
  }
  if = {
    limit = {
      scope:key = { ... }
    }
    subtract = scope:kvp.kvp_to_value
  }
}
```
## Remove
```
remove_dict_variable = {
  variable = dictionary_name
  key = numeric_key
}
```
## IDs
```
every_country = {
  set_dict_id = yes # Generates a new ID for this scope if one does not already exist
  save_temporary_scope_as = country
  every_scope_culture = {
    add_to_dict = {
      dict  = dictionary_name
      key   = scope:country.var:dict_id # The generated ID is safe to use as a unique key
      value = numeric_value
    }
  }
}
```

# Parties

For naming, you need to include loc keys to avoid load-up error. These can be blank and overwritten by your own mod. 

# Community Mod Triggers

## Usage
Request to have CMF add a trigger for your mod into the CMF compatibility file `01_community_mod_compatibility_triggers.txt`.
This file contains the scripted triggers all set to return false by default. This is intentional. Your trigger should look like this:
```
YOURMODNAME_is_active_trigger = {
   always = no
}
```
Create another file with the name `zz_YOURMODNAME_compatibility_triggers.txt` in the `/common/scripted_triggers` folder of your mod,
that contains the following:
```
YOURMODNAME_is_active_trigger = {
   always = yes
}
```

# Keybinds

You can take a free keybind by doing this:
1) Check default.profile and see which keybind is still free. You can find free keybinds at the bottom of the file.
2) Add input_action = "input_$your_input$" to the button you want to use it for.
3) Add a localization for your button to "localization/language_x/replace" and use the name of the input_action.

Note: It is possible to add additional keybinds if there are no keybinds left.

# Additional Modifier Icons

Over 100 new modifier icons for more variety. Credit to Caelreader. PSD template available in docs.

# Heir Blocker

Mods interested in having specially generated heirs (especially for things like historical heirs) in countries with hereditary transfers of power can utilize the Heir Blocking Framework's feature to prevent the visual appearance of an heir. That is, while the heir technically is generated (as there is no useful way to prevent that), we can intercept the new heir and remove them whilst blocking the "Heir Born" message at the same time, giving the *appearance* to the user that no heirs are actually being born.

To use it, just set a variable named `no_heirs` in the country that should have its heirs blocked; e.g.,
```
c:GBR = {
    set_variable = no_heirs
}
```
Modified on action logic for heir births will take care of the rest automatically.

To allow randomly-generated heirs again, simply remove the variable.

Note:
1. No considerations have been made regarding any failsafes. You are solely responsible for unblocking heirs later, even if the country switches away from a government type with hereditary transfer of power.
2. Heirs created via `create_character` and heirs set via `set_heir` are *not* blocked, as they do not count as a "natural" heir birth. This means the variable does not need to be briefly unset when generating or setting heirs via script, such as for historical heirs.

# Weekly Event Framework

This is a framework to allow for a weekly firing script event on any day of the week, without a hidden journal entry being used.

To use:
1. Create a new `on_monthly_pulse` or reuse an existing one.
2. Set it up like in `com_weekly_on_action.txt`:
3. Add your own `on_action` to the `on_monthly_pulse` from step 1.
4. Add the `com_run_weekly_event_country_effect` into this new on_action and set the two parameters. Example: `com_run_weekly_event_country_effect = { weekday = 1 on_action = another_on_action }`. Weekday decides the weekday ranging from 0 (Sunday) to 6 (Saturday).
5. Define your new on_action (`another_on_action` in the example in 4.)


# Hide/Show Journal Entry Groups

This allows for hiding and showing any Journal Entry Group.

Usage:
`com_hide_journal_entry_group = { name = je_group_historical_content }` 
This would hide all National Agenda (`je_group_historical_content`) Journal Entries.

`com_show_journal_entry_group = { name = je_group_historical_content }` 
This would show them again.

# Formation Event Blocker

This allows for blocking the formation events that occur whenever the player forms a country. This can be used for blocking the events' effect of adding claims to all homeland states which is vanilla behavior.

To use it, just set a variable named `com_no_formation_events` in the country that should have formation events blocked; e.g.,
```
c:GRE = {
    set_variable = com_no_formation_events
}
```

To allow formation events again, simply remove the variable.

Notes:
1. No considerations have been made regarding any failsafes. You are solely responsible for unblocking formation events later, even if the country successfully completes additional formations.
2. Changing country via the `change_tag` effect will **not** remove the `com_no_formation_events`variable.

# Built-In Universal Names Compatibility

CMF sets up seamless compatibility with [FUN's Universal Names mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2880875193) for its own use in certain GUI windows, but it can be used by any other mods as well.

The Universal Names mod, among a few other things, corrects the display of full names for characters belonging to cultures whose full name order is `Last-First`, as opposed to `First-Last`, improving the presentation of relevant cultures, especially East Asian characters or Hungarians.

Universal Names works by replacing `Character.GetFullName` calls in GUI and localization with a call to a customizable localization it defines. CMF defines clones of these custom locs in a manner that allows UN to overwrite them if UN is enabled; otherwise, CMF's definitions provide a fallback to the equivalent datafunctions. This allows seamless compatibility with compliant text - any applicable characters will either have their names displayed identically to vanilla, or their names will be fixed if the user has UN installed without any additional actions required on the user's part.

In the interest of promoting this improved user experience, it is recommended to use the Universal Names custom locs for printing full names in any journals, events, GUIs, etc. whenever they are used. Below is a list of all the vanilla name datafunctions and their Universal Names custom locs counterparts which CMF provides seamless compatibility for:
```
Character.GetFullName                      => Character.GetCustom('GetUniversalFullName')
Character.GetFullNameNoFormatting          => Character.GetCustom('GetUniversalFullNameNoFormatting')
Character.GetFullNameWithTitle             => Character.GetCustom('GetUniversalFullNameWithTitle')
Character.GetFullNameWithTitleNoFormatting => Character.GetCustom('GetUniversalFullNameWithTitleNoFormatting')
Character.GetPrimaryRoleTitle              => Character.GetCustom('GetUniversalTitle')
```
Simple localization usage example:
```
original_text: "Hello, my name is [Character.GetFullNameNoFormatting]"
improved_text: "Hello, my name is [Character.GetCustom('GetUniversalFullNameNoFormatting')]"
```
Consider a Korean character whose name in the real world would be written as `Yi Sun-sin`. Korean names are `Last-First` names, so `Sun-sin` is the given name and `Yi` is the surname.
- With `original_text`, it would render as `Hello, my name is Sun-sin Yi`. In reality this would be *incorrect*.
- With `improved_text`, it would render as `Hello, my name is Yi Sun-sin`. This is correct and improves character flavor!
